How to translate (for beginners):

1) Do the normal configure steps in main directory to get makefiles.
2) Do 'make ln.pox', where <ln> is your language to get a new pox-file
3) Translating the new file:
   a) Enter texts for any new translation string.
   b) Remove any commented old strings (at end of file).
   c) Correct anything with "fuzzy" keyword and remove the keyword afterwards.
   d) Be careful - fuzzy somethimes means printf-specifiers may have changed - 
      e.g. from %d to %u - fix these or it will be very hard to find the
      errors resulting from this.
   e) Use diff between old and new file as often as necessary to find
      everything which needs to be changed.
4) Copy the new pox file to the corresponding po file and call make to see if
   there are warnings or errors.
5) Have a last look at the complete file to see if something has been forgotten
   or is wrong.
6) Send the new file to the current maintainer for inclusion in release.
