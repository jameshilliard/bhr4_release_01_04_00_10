This directory contains colections of button icons for pavuk

If you want change your icons, use your pavukrc file, and set your icons
with Btn*Icon*: options, or befor compilation copy files which you like
to directory src/icons.

If you have any nice collection of icons for pavuk and you want to share it,
feel free to send it to me, and I will include it to next pavuk release.
