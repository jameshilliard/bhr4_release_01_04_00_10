	  Netscape or Mozilla browser cache directory
	- optionaly zlib library to support document decoding without calling
	  gzip program
	- optionaly pthread (POSIX threads) library for support multithreading
	  (in this case all other used libraries should be compiled and 
           designed to support multithreading - mainly X and GTK)
	- optionaly libdes or OpenSSL libcrypto to support NTLM authorization
	- optionaly Mozillas JavaScript runtime library libjs to support
	  JavaScript bindings

			   supported implementation
	--with-ssl=[none/auto/openssl/ssleay/nss]
			 - for selecting requested SSL library implementation
	--with-desimpl=[none/auto/libcrypto/libdes/libmcrypt/libgcrypt]
			 - for selecting requested DES algorithm implementation
			   library
	--with-egd-socket=NAME - use NAME for the EGD socket

for more options check configure --help

to compile package, type at commandline

	make
